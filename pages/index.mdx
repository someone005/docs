# Introduction

Community Ox is an organization dedicated to maintaining forks of most Overextended resources after the original Overextended team archived their work. We align with their original mission—to provide free, open-source, high-quality resources for the community—and are focused on maintaining core resources like ox_lib, ox_inventory, and ox_core

If you feel like our documentation is lacking, please let us know or suggest improvements by using the links in the sidebar.

## Maintainers

## Legacy team (2021-2025)

Overextended was a team of hobbyists and professional developers who collaborated between 2021 and 2025 to create high-quality, open-source resources for the FiveM community. Their work focused on performance, stability, and security — often involving complex projects that required a significant amount of time and dedication.

Although the team is no longer active, their contributions continue to support and inspire the community. If you'd like to show appreciation for their past work, you can do so below.

## Creator codes

Creator codes allow Tebex stores to share revenue with other creators, giving a discount to the customer at the same time.
We make these deals to advertise trusted creators who meet our criteria.

- Resources are highly configurable or, preferably, source-available.
- We trust that customers will be given assistance.
- The creator is a known member of our community.
